# Final Summary - T1: Planning and Designing an Interactive ‚ÄòMinichess‚Äô Command-Line Simulator

## Overview

This project delivers a fully documented design plan for an interactive Minichess simulator based on the Los Alamos variant. The game is designed as a **command-line application** with support for both **two-player** and **single-player (CPU)** modes. The implementation plan is tailored to Python but remains language-agnostic for C++ or F# adaptation.

## Design Principles Followed

### üîç Theoretical Foundations

- **Set Theory:** Used for defining piece types, players, and positions.
- **Hoare Logic:** Used for specifying interaction invariants.
- **Mathematical Functions & Relations:** Defined game behaviors (e.g., move validation, checkmate).
- **Graph Theory:** Modeled board states and turn transitions.

## Conclusion

This document set represents a **FAANG-level** software architecture approach to the Minichess game. It enables clear implementation steps, modular design, and academic rigor by grounding decisions in formal logic, set theory, and functional mappings.

**Next Steps:**
- Convert each design section into working Python/C++ code.
- Expand CPU intelligence with deeper evaluation trees.
- Consider GUI or Web interface in future versions.
